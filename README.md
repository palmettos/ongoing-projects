# ongoing-projects
A collection of recent, ongoing projects that I'm working on.

d2ext - A desktop application that communicates with DiabloInterface through a win32 pipe. It will push this data to an extension backend service for communicating with Twitch's frontend pub/sub. It will allow viewers to see currently equipped items on Diablo 2 streams as a video overlay extension.

neatstuff - Some tests I was doing with evolving recurrent neural networks to learn technical indicator patterns in cryptocurrency price movements.

pybitbot - A bot that farms bits on Twitch. It separates the state space of a Twitch page into graph nodes and represents the actions required to switch between states as graph edges. The bit farming process is automated by constructing paths through this state space using Djikstra's algorithm.

pyramidbot - An IRC bot that interrupts "emote pyramids" in Twitch chat.

starseed - A tentatively named, unfinished game I worked on for a period of time.
